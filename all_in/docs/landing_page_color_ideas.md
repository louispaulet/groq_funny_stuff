# Landing Page Color Concepts

These bold color directions complement the existing Groq AllIn Studio logo background (#4f46e5) while staying consistent with the current overview hero gradient that flows from brand-600 into indigo accents.

| Color Direction | Hex | Why it fits the logo | Brand alignment rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hyper Violet Surge | #7c3aed | Extends the purple family anchored by the logo while adding more vibrancy for the hero gradient. | Signals experimental, future-forward energy that matches the studio's multi-experience positioning without breaking brand recognition. |
| Electric Azure Pulse | #2563eb | Introduces a bold electric blue that bridges the current indigo gradient with a brighter tech-forward accent. | Reinforces the platform's precision tooling narrative by evoking trust and high-performance computing. |
| Neon Ember Orange | #ea580c | Provides a high-contrast highlight against the indigo/purple base, creating a dramatic CTA-ready accent. | Conveys confident creativity and the "all experiences" story by injecting warmth without straying too far from the energetic Groq brand voice. |
| Aurora Mint Radiance | #14b8a6 | Adds a saturated teal that pairs with existing cyan gradients on the overview while keeping the palette modern. | Reflects the product's versatility and innovation, tying into the current emerald-to-cyan spotlight section and reinforcing a cohesive journey across modules. |

Use these options individually or in gradient combinations to keep the landing page feeling fresh while maintaining coherence with existing brand tokens.
