        📘 The Pokédex workspace is a focused encyclopedia for trainers. Ask about any Pokémon and you will get
        typings, strengths, weaknesses, and a bite-sized lore blurb sourced from our remote service. It is tuned to
        stay in-universe: off-topic questions politely steer you back to the Pokédex. 🎓

        Combine it with team-building sessions or quick reminders before a battle. Because the base URL is
        configurable, you can point the workspace at experimental datasets or community-maintained entries while
        keeping the same interface. 🔄
