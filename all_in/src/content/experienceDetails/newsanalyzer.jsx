        🗞️ News Analyzer connects to a Cloudflare Worker that aggregates live articles, quotes, and metadata from
        across the web. Start by filtering the beats you care about—markets, climate, geopolitics—and the assistant
        contextualizes the incoming headlines with timelines, related coverage, and source links. It is a rapid way to
        separate the signal from the noise. 📊

      <p>
        Ask for comparisons, bullet summaries, or follow-up questions and the assistant grounds responses in the fetched
        documents, noting when context is thin or evolving. Pin the conversations you want to revisit and export
        briefings for stakeholders. Analysts, comms teams, and curious readers all get a high-velocity newsroom
        companion. 📰
