        🚗 Car Maker doubles as a concept studio for automotive storytellers. Start by selecting a marque, paint
        finish, and performance stance, then layer in cinematic lighting cues like dusk reflections or rain-slick
        asphalt. The assistant keeps recommendations grounded in automotive vocabulary—splitters, wheel fitment, aero
        kits—so each prompt reads like a creative brief a photographer would love. 🌆

        Once generated, swap environments, colorways, or camera focal lengths to craft an entire campaign from a single
        session. The gallery remembers your best looks and surfaces the prompt metadata for future shoots. Great for
        designers pitching concept decks, agencies iterating mood boards, or fans dreaming up their next build. 🏁
