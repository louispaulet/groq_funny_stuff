        🛡️ AllergyFinder taps into Open Food Facts so it can examine ingredient panels in context. Bring your saved
        allergen profile into the conversation and the assistant highlights risky ingredients, suggests safe
        alternatives, and drafts grocery lists that respect your preferences. Transparency comes first: responses
        call out when product data is missing or when you should double-check real-world packaging. 🧾

        Use it for meal planning, quick label triage, or inspiration when you are cooking for friends with different
        dietary needs. Because it runs on Groq-accelerated LLMs, you get near-instant summaries even for lengthy
        ingredient lists. 🚀
