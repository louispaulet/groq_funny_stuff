        🍕 Pizza Maker feels like running your own test kitchen. Choose sauces, cheeses, toppings, and surface
        treatments while the assistant suggests inventive combinations—truffle honey on a blistered crust, charred
        broccolini with smoked mozzarella, or a Detroit-style corner slice with an HDR drizzle. Every configuration
        becomes a lush prompt that Groq sends to the Flux image backend for plating. 🔥

        As soon as the render lands, you can tweak the brief and spin up variants to compare crust textures, camera
        angles, or prop styling. Save favorites, export the art direction notes, and share a mood board with your team.
        It is ideal for restaurants, food stylists, or anyone craving a hyper-real hero shot. 📸
