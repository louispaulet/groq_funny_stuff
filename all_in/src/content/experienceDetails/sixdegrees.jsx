        üé≠ Six Degrees Of is a parody escalator. Drop in any sentence and we will send it through six rapid-fire
        parodies, each one riffing only on what came immediately before it. The responses show up one-by-one so you can
        watch the humor mutate in real time. ‚è±Ô∏è

      <p>
        Under the hood it taps the same Groq-accelerated chat endpoint, but with a playful system prompt that keeps
        each remix short, witty, and distinct from the original. Use it for creative warm-ups, writing prompts, or just
        a quick laugh between tasks. üòÑ
