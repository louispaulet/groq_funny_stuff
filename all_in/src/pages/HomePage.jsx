      <p>
        🛡️ AllergyFinder taps into Open Food Facts so it can examine ingredient panels in context. Bring your saved allergen
        profile into the conversation and the assistant highlights risky ingredients, suggests safe alternatives, and drafts
        grocery lists that respect your preferences. Transparency comes first: responses call out when product data is
        missing or when you should double-check real-world packaging. 🧾
      </p>
      <p>
        Use it for meal planning, quick label triage, or inspiration when you are cooking for friends with different dietary
        needs. Because it runs on Groq-accelerated LLMs, you get near-instant summaries even for lengthy ingredient lists. 🚀

  objectmaker: (

      <p>
        🧠 Object Maker is a workspace for structured creativity. Start with a conversational brief and the assistant drafts JSON
        schemas that describe imaginative artifacts—anything from a pizza, to a track-ready car, to a curated ice cream
        flight. Once the schema looks right, you can call the
        <code className="rounded bg-slate-900/80 px-1 py-0.5 text-[0.7rem] text-white">/obj</code> endpoint to spin up
        dozens of variants that adhere to the structure. The workflow is grounded in Groq hosted
        <span className="font-medium"> openai/gpt-oss-20b</span> and <span className="font-medium">openai/gpt-oss-120b</span>
        models, keeping generation fast while your schema evolves. ⚙️
      </p>
      <p>
        Each session curates a “Zoo” of finished creations so you can revisit, iterate, and compare outputs. The aim is to
        demonstrate how reliable JSON scaffolding unlocks downstream tooling: the sharper the schema, the more dependable the
        generated objects. Image generation integrations are planned, but today is about perfecting the structured prompt. 🗂️

  stlviewer: (
    <>
      <p>
        🧩 STL Studio preserves the original 3D printing workflow. The assistant can draft STL snippets, explain mesh edits, and,
        thanks to the embedded viewer, render models directly inside the chat transcript. Share a design tweak, paste an STL
        file, and see the preview update without leaving the conversation. 🖥️
      </p>
      <p>
        It is ideal for rapid iteration on printable parts, offering slicing tips, material suggestions, and context-aware
        troubleshooting. Whether you are validating overhangs or collaborating on a new gadget, the mix of text guidance and
        inline visuals keeps the feedback loop tight. 🔁

  pokedex: (

      <p>
        📘 The Pokédex workspace is a focused encyclopedia for trainers. Ask about any Pokémon and you will get typings,
        strengths, weaknesses, and a bite-sized lore blurb sourced from our remote service. It is tuned to stay in-universe:
        off-topic questions politely steer you back to the Pokédex. 🎓
      </p>
      <p>
        Combine it with team-building sessions or quick reminders before a battle. Because the base URL is configurable, you
        can point the workspace at experimental datasets or community-maintained entries while keeping the same interface. 🔄
      </p>

  sixdegrees: (

      <p>
        🎭 Six Degrees Of is a parody escalator. Drop in any sentence and we will send it through six rapid-fire parodies,
        each one riffing only on what came immediately before it. The responses show up one-by-one so you can watch the
        humor mutate in real time. ⏱️
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the hood it taps the same Groq-accelerated chat endpoint, but with a playful system prompt that keeps each
        remix short, witty, and distinct from the original. Use it for creative warm-ups, writing prompts, or just a quick
        laugh between tasks. 😄
