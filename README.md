## Pokédex (Gradio app)

A lightweight, local Pokédex chat where you can ask questions about a Pokémon and get a concise 2–3 sentence answer.

Run it:

- `python src/pokedex_app.py` (direct) or
- `python -m src.pokedex_app` (as a module)

Examples:

- "What are Charizard’s weaknesses?"
- "Tell me about Pikachu"
- "Which type is Gengar?"

Notes:

- Uses a small built-in dataset (no network required).
- Supports topics like types, weaknesses, abilities, evolution, height/weight, moves, and general info.
